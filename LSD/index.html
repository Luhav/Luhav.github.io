					The LSD is descended from various BSD licenses, and contains a nod to both its conveniently entertaining name, and "the dolphin license". 
					It is very similar to Public Domain dedication, however, comes with the caveats that the licensee cannot claim the licensor(s) endorse their derivative work, and that the licensee explicitly may not claim the licensensor's work as their own.
